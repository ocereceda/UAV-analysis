This repository includes the datasets used for validation of the EPP FPV and Giant Big Stik (GBS) JSBSim computer models. It includes:
1. Original datasets of the EPP FPV and Giant Big Stik (GBS) UAVs flights
2. Flight divided in sections depending on the elevator/aileron deflections range
3. scriptGBS script: plots of the GBS deflections for the real flight tests
4. elevator_vs_tau script: plot of the simulation results when studying tau vs elevator deflection (GBS)
5. EPPFPV_correlation script: table with correlation coefficients of simulation vs. realflight for the EPP FPV
6. GBS_correlation script: table with correlation coefficients of simulation vs. realflight for the GBS
